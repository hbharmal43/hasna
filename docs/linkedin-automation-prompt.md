# LinkedIn Easy Apply Automation Extension

## Overview
This project aims to develop a browser extension that automates the LinkedIn "Easy Apply" job application process. The extension will search for jobs with the "Easy Apply" feature, automatically apply to them using pre-saved information, and continue this process in a loop until manually stopped by the user.

## Tech Stack
- **TypeScript**: For enhanced type safety and better code maintainability
- **React**: For building robust and maintainable UI components
- **Chrome Extension API**: For browser extension framework
- **DOM Manipulation**: For interacting with LinkedIn's web elements
- **CSS Selectors**: For targeting specific elements on LinkedIn
- **Chrome Storage API**: For saving user preferences and application data
- **Async/Await**: For handling sequential application steps
- **State Management**: For managing complex application states
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: For comprehensive testing

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize extension project structure with manifest.json
- Set up TypeScript configuration
- Configure React with necessary build tools (webpack/vite)
- Set up permissions for accessing LinkedIn
- Create extension popup/options UI for user configuration
- Implement basic state management structure

### 2. LinkedIn Page Analysis
- Analyze LinkedIn job search page structure
- Identify CSS selectors for:
  - Easy Apply filter toggle
  - Job cards in search results
  - Easy Apply buttons
  - Application form elements
  - Submit/Next buttons
  - Close dialog buttons

### 3. Job Search Automation
- Implement function to navigate to LinkedIn Jobs
- Add capability to set search parameters (location, keywords, etc.)
- Create logic to filter for "Easy Apply" jobs only

### 4. Application Process Automation
- Develop function to click on job listings sequentially
- Create handlers for the application modal popup
- Implement form filling logic using saved user data
- Program next/submit button detection and clicking
- Handle different application form variations

### 5. Loop Implementation
- Create main control loop for continuous applications
- Implement pagination handling for moving through job search results
- Add tracking for applied jobs to avoid duplicates

### 6. User Controls & Configuration
- Develop pause/resume functionality
- Implement manual stop capability
- Create settings for application preferences
- Add options for customizing application answers

### 7. Monitoring & Reporting
- Track successful applications
- Create simple dashboard to show progress
- Implement basic analytics (success rate, applications per hour)

### 8. Error Handling
- Develop robust error recovery mechanisms
- Implement timeout handling for slow-loading elements
- Create fallbacks for unexpected page structures

### 9. Testing & Refinement
- Test across different LinkedIn layouts
- Handle edge cases (no more jobs, account restrictions)
- Optimize performance and reliability

### 10. Deployment
- Package extension for Chrome/Firefox stores
- Create documentation for installation and usage
- Implement update mechanism

## Additional Configuration Considerations

### Application Timing
- Implement configurable delay between applications (e.g., 30-60 seconds) to appear more human-like
- Add random variation to timing to avoid detection
- Include option for "working hours only" mode to simulate natural application patterns
- Allow for scheduled breaks to mimic human behavior

### Multi-Step Application Criteria
- Implement logic to decide whether to continue applications requiring:
  - Additional questions beyond the basic form
  - Skill assessments or tests
  - Custom cover letters
- Add intelligence to recognize and skip applications requesting:
  - Phone numbers before submission
  - Salary expectations
  - Start date availability
  - Years of experience outside user-defined range
- Create option to abandon applications after a certain number of steps (e.g., stop if more than 3 screens)

### Job Targeting
- Create advanced filtering capabilities for:
  - Specific job titles or keywords (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Data Scientist")
  - Experience levels (Entry, Mid-Senior, Executive)
  - Industries of interest
  - Company size preferences
  - Remote/hybrid/on-site preferences
- Implement negative filters to automatically skip certain keywords
- Add company blacklist/whitelist functionality
- Create logic to prioritize applications based on posting date (newest first)
- Implement screening for salary ranges when available
